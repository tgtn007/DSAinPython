# Find the floored square root of the number
## Approach
I used binary search algorithm to divide the search space each time into half and then use the side depending whether the square root
of the number would lie.

## Time Complexity 
My approach takes O(LogN) time as it is dividing the search into half each time.

## Space Complexity 
My approach is taking O(1) space complexity as we are not storing any lists or using any data structure.
