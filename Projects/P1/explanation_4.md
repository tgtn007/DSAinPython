### Problem 3
#### Active Directory

We are using recursion in this question to iterate through all the groups in the given group and to check if it exists

In the worst case complexity when the element is not found so that we have to iterate till the end is O(N) its M + N
where M is the number of total users in all the groups combined and N is number of groups inside the given group.
