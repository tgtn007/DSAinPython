## Data Structure 
The data structure used here is dictionary to determine the frequency of each characters, Then binary tree were used to
store the data as huffman tree.

## Time Complexity
Encoding - It takes O(m * m Log m) time to iterate through all the characters in string and sorting then again for new
node.
Decoding - Decoding takes O(N) time to iterate through all the data.

## Space Complexity
The total space required is O(N) as the size of the tree to store all the characters.
